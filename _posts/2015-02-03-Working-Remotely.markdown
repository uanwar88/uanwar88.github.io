title:  "Working Remotely"
---

I don't like working remotely. It's more difficult to discuss things. It's nice to be able to get up and walk over and talk to people. There's Slack, of course, but sometimes it can be hard to type or say a lot on Slack without miscommunicating what you're trying to say, or what the other person is saying to you. I did miss everyone. <3

Also, it's much harder to focus. For me, I ended up taking 2.5 hours to dig out my car and go do the groceries. Probably couldn't do that on a regular day. But, it is nice to be able to make a warm lunch. 

Working somewhere where remote work is the norm would probably not be ideal for me, but doable. Would just have to break the habit of working in my jammies.
